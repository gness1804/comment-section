##Comment Section

This is an exercise to improve my object-oriented skills. I've built a simple mock comments section with the roles of user, moderator, and super user, and gave each distinct properties and methods. This isn't meant to be a production-level app, but rather an opportunity for me to improve my knowledge of object-oriented programming. I learned a lot from doing this exercise.

Built from my [Bash Scripts Webpack Starter Kit](https://github.com/gness1804/bash-scripts-for-webpack).
